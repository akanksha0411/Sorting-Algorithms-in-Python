I have implemented a few common sorting algorithms in Python. Hope it helps to someone who wants to learn about sorting techniques using Python. Happy coding!

# Bubble Sort Algorithm
I suppose bubble sort is one of the easiest sorting algorithms available at present. Easy to understand and easy to implement. It is an in-place and stable sorting algorithm.
  Bubble sort traverses through the array to be sorted and compares adjacent pairs of elements. If the elements are in wrong order i.e. inverted, they are swapped. This procedure is repeated over through the unsorted portion of the array until the complete array is sorted.
  As bubble sort passes through the unsorted part of the list for every unsorted element, it has a worst case complexity of O(n^2).
